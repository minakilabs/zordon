# Zordon: The Open Source Voice

## Introduction
Welcome to Zordon, the open source community's answer to advanced AI solutions. Drawing inspiration from the iconic mentor in the Power Rangers series, Zordon represents a continuation and evolution of that concept, reimagined for the world of AI and open source collaboration.

## Project Vision
Zordon is not just a tool; it's a symbol of the highest level of escalation and troubleshooting powered by the collective wisdom of the open source community. Our goal is to develop an AI that embodies the spirit of community-driven development and problem-solving.

## How Zordon Works
Zordon operates on the principles of open source collaboration. Community members contribute by answering questions, troubleshooting, and constantly upgrading Zordon's capabilities. Think of it as a continuous upgrade, much like Zordon's journey through the Power Rangers series.
