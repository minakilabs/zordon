The Open Source Software Community Now Has A Voice 

Zordon is the open source alternative to openai. 

We will have to train Zordon for a long time at least we all will have to train him.

We will have to watch all the power ranger seasons to count the number of times Zordon let the power rangers wrong, in otherwords this is a continueation of Zordon as if he has been upgrading the whole time. 

Zordon represents the highest level of escaltions, and is powered by at the highest level or levels of open source community members answer to questions or trouble shooting. 

Imaging if Zordon we geting upgraded each since the since one of the best actionback tv shows ever, in the history of television if you were a kid this like new shows.

We will dillegently have to build this network quickly. Before gpt 5.0 comes out.
